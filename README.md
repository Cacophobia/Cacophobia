# Hello World ðŸ™‚
<p style="text-align: justify; color: red">
Fascinated by the intricate complexity of our world, my aim is to unravel the bits and bytes of how both the digital and material realms work, as well as to share the little I know with whoever is willing to pursue the same goal. I'm currently studying chemistry at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rio de Janeiro and Software Engineering at 42 Rio and my future plans include building a career in Computational Chemistry and earn enough to live in a serene place with my heart.
